# NeuroLullaby: Adaptive Bedtime Storytelling Using EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface for Sleep Health

<img src="resources/Front_Page_bg.png" width="300px">

Welcome to the **NeuroLullaby** project! This research explores how **EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI)** can be used for adaptive **Speech Generation**. It was developed as part of the course project for **NUS CS5647: Sound and Music Computing**.

## üöÄ Project Overview
NeuroLullaby utilizes real-time **EEG signal processing** to dynamically adjust bedtime stories, enhancing relaxation and promoting better sleep.

- **EEG Data Collection**: Uses the **BrainCo Focus Zen** device to collect and preprocess EEG signals.
- **Adaptive Storytelling**: Analyzes EEG patterns to modify storytelling parameters.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Utilizes **Microsoft TTS API** for generating audio content.
- **Sleep Health Focus**: Designed to optimize relaxation before sleep.
